## 1. Corruption x Traffic Violations Analysis

[Here's the paper!](https://guilherme-schiavi.github.io/corruptiondata/)

• This project involves analyzing a corruption dataset obtained from the Journal of Political Economy (v. 15, n. 6, p. 1020-1048, 2007)

• The aim is to explore the relationship between traffic violations, the number of staff members, and the corruption index of their respective countries.

• The dataset will be pre-processed to identify patterns and insights, and various statistical and machine learning techniques will be used to visualize the data.

• Algorithms used: GLM - Poisson, Zero-Inflated Poissonm, Negative Binomial and Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial
